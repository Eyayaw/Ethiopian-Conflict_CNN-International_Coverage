## How has cnni covered the conflict? 

> See it for yourself on [Google News](https://google.com/search?q=site:https://cnn.com+after:2020-11-02+"Ethiopia"+AND+"Tigray"+-"Covid"+-"Nile"+&tbm=nws+&lr=lang_en+tbs=sbd:1+)

## Goal of this repo

Produce a list of CNN's stories ever since the conflict broke out, November 4, 2020. 

I have managed to scrape news articles that CNN published ever since. You can find the details about these news articles in this [this csv file](articles-meta.csv), in the same directory. 


CNN does not produce news only in an article form. There are live news coverages with a mass of short "posts" (e.g. [here](https://edition.cnn.com/africa/live-news/ethiopia-conflict-updates-11-5-intl/index.html)), and video reportings (e.g. [here](https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2021/06/13/ethiopia-famine-thousands-facing-starvation-busari-lklv-nr-intl-vpx.cnn)) as well. This repo contains details about such coverages too.
