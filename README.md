## The start of the conflict
> **November 03, 2021** 

## How has cnni covered the conflict? 

> See it for yourself on [Google News](https://google.com/search?q=site:https://cnn.com+after:2020-11-02+"Ethiopia"+AND+"Tigray"+-"Covid"+-"Nile"+&tbm=nws+&lr=lang_en+tbs=sbd:1+)

## Goal of this repo

* Produce a list of CNN's stories ever since the conflict broke out, November 4, 2020. 

## So far

* [x] **Articles**: 
    I have managed to scrape news articles that CNN published ever since. You can find the details about these news articles in this [csv file](articles-meta.csv), in the same directory. 


```r
articles = read.csv('articles-meta.csv')
articles$url = with(articles, 
                    sprintf('<a href="%s">%s</a>', 
                            url, basename(sub('/index.html', '', url)))
                    )
DT::datatable(articles, 
              options = list(pageLength=5), filter = "top", escape = F)
```
